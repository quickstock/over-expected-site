        FTAOE, free throw attempts over expected, is how many shooting-foul
        free throws a player draws per 100 possessions, compared with the
        league-average rate. FTAOE = actual FTA − expected FTA; the per-100
        version divides by the possessions a player finished.
      </p>

      <H2>What counts as a shooting foul</H2>
      <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-base">
        <p>
          Only free throws from shooting fouls count: and-1s and fouled misses
          (two or three attempts). Free throws from the bonus on non-shooting
          fouls, technicals, and flagrants are excluded, as are off-ball
          fouls. Attempts are attributed to the player who finished the
          possession: the one fouled in the act of shooting.
        </p>
        <p>
          The data is possession-level play-by-play:{" "}
          <span className="font-mono tnum">{int(meta.nPossessions)}</span>{" "}
          possessions across {int(seasons.length)} seasons, {seasons[0]} to{" "}
          {seasons[seasons.length - 1]}. Each possession's target is the
          number of shooting-foul free throws it produced (almost always 0,
          occasionally 2 or 3).
        </p>
      </div>

      <H2>Why per possession</H2>
      <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-base">
        <p>
          A fouled miss is not a charged field-goal attempt and has no shot
          location in the play-by-play. Any per-shot rate therefore silently
          drops the exact events this stat is made of, and punishes the
          players who draw the most fouls. Possessions don't have that
          problem: every trip ends somewhere, fouled or not. So the rate is
          per possession, and the leaderboard's unit is FTAOE per 100
          possessions.
        </p>
      </div>

      <H2>The baseline</H2>
      <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-base">
        <p>
          Expected FTA is the league-average shooting-foul rate times the
          possessions a player finished, season by season:{" "}
          {seasons.map((sn, i) => (
            <span key={sn}>
              <span className="font-mono tnum">
                {meta.leagueRateBySeason[sn].toFixed(1)}
              </span>{" "}
              in {sn}
              {i < seasons.length - 1 ? ", " : "."}
            </span>
          ))}
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of that rate we fit a context model: a Poisson GLM (log
          link, no interactions) on seven features that are all external to
          the player. Four describe game state (period, seconds remaining in
          the period, score margin, a late-game bonus proxy) and three
          describe the situation: whether the offense is at home, the
          opponent's shooting-foul rate, and the assigned officiating crew's
          foul rate. The opponent and crew rates are season-specific and
          leave-one-game-out, so a game's own outcomes never enter its own
          features. Validation is season cross-fitting (train on five
          seasons, predict the held-out sixth). One correction to an earlier
          version of this page, which said every prediction was out-of-fold:
          the <em>coefficients</em> are, but the opponent and crew rates are
          built within each season including the held-out one, so those two
          features are not. Rebuilt from the training seasons only they add
          nothing at all, and the deviance reduction falls from{" "}
          <span className="font-mono tnum">0.20%</span> to{" "}
          <span className="font-mono tnum">0.15%</span>, which is the same
          conclusion, arrived at honestly. Earlier versions included shot
          location and
          play-resolution features and looked far stronger; that strength was
          leakage (the features encoded how the possession ended), and they
          were removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Expected is then anchored to each season's own league rate: the
          held-out season's predictions are scaled so their mean equals that
          season's actual rate. Anchoring keeps FTAOE a within-season
          comparison, which is what it claims to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page used to explain the scaling factors as a correction for
          rule changes, citing the 2021-22 enforcement change on
          non-basketball moves. That explanation was wrong. The factors are
          almost exactly{" "}
          <span className="font-mono tnum">1.021</span> in every season, which
          is the ratio between all possessions and the ones with an
          attributable finisher: the model is fitted on possessions that
          include roughly 28,600 with no finisher, which carry zero
          shooting-foul free throws by construction and drag the fitted mean
          down. Refitting on the attributable possessions alone moves the
          factors to about{" "}
          <span className="font-mono tnum">0.999</span>, and the 2021-22
          crackdown leaves no signature in either version. The scaling was
          fixing our own fitting universe, not the league's. That refit is
          pending here.
        </p>
        <p className="border-l-2 border-line pl-4 text-ink">
          The honest punchline: out-of-fold, the full context model (game
          state, home court, opponent, officiating crew) reduces Poisson
          deviance by just{" "}
          <span className="font-mono tnum">{meta.modelLiftPct.toFixed(2)}%</span>{" "}
          against each season's own league-average rate. We adjusted for who
          you played, where, and who officiated, and it still barely moves.
          FTAOE is, in practice, "versus league average", and the site
          presents it that way.

        <p>
          Player pages also show a second, labeled number that answers a
          different question: how many shooting-foul free throws does a
          player draw above what his attack profile predicts? The baseline
          is a player-season Poisson model whose only inputs are exposure
          counts from NBA tracking data: drives, paint touches, and post
          touches per 100 possessions. It is fit the same leak-free way
          (train on five seasons, predict the sixth, anchor to the season),
          and the player's own free-throw outcomes on those plays are never
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attack profile alone explains most foul-drawing volume (predicted
          and actual FTA correlate around 0.85 season over season). The
          residual separates two archetypes the headline number mixes: the
          high-volume interior player whose big FTAOE comes with enormous
          paint volume, and the per-exposure specialist who converts each
          drive or touch into free throws at an unusual rate. Neither
          reading is more correct; they answer different questions, which is
          why both numbers are shown and labeled.

      <H2>Shot value and shot-making</H2>
      <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-base">
        <p>
          FTAOE asks who draws fouls. The leaderboard, every player page, and
          the League board also ask the fuller question: what a shot is worth,
          counting both making it and the fouls it draws. Three lenses, same
          player pool: <strong className="font-semibold">shot value</strong>{" "}
          (combined), <strong className="font-semibold">shot-making</strong>{" "}
          (field goals only), and{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="font-semibold">xFG%.</strong> A gradient-boosted
          model gives every field-goal attempt a make probability from shot
          context only: location, distance, zone, action type, shot type,
          period, clock, and score margin, never who took it. It is trained
          leak-free by season cross-fit, like the foul model: for each season
          it trains on the other five and predicts that one, so a shot's
          expected make never comes from a model that saw it. Summed over a
          player's attempts, xFG% is the quality of the looks he takes; actual
          FG% minus xFG% is shot-making over expected, expressed as field-goal
          points over expected per 100 possessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong className="font-semibold">Shot value</strong> fuses the two.
          Per shot, expected points are{" "}
          <span className="font-mono text-[13px]">
            xFG% × (2 or 3) + xFTA × 0.77
          </span>
          . The headline is points over expected per 100: field goals made
          above the look's difficulty, plus the free throws drawn above
          expectation. Both halves credit conversion: field goals at the
          player's actual rate, and the free throws he draws valued at his own
          season free-throw percentage (the expected attempts valued at the
          league rate, ~0.77). So a foul magnet who shoots 90% from the line
          banks more per trip than one who shoots 60%, and the number reflects
          it; an earlier version valued both at the league rate and quietly
          erased that difference.

          <strong className="font-semibold">Teams</strong> get the same three
          lenses on the League board, both ends: what a team creates on offense
          and what it concedes on defense. At team level the free-throw side is
          valued at the league rate rather than a team free-throw percentage,
          which is a weaker, separate thing and is left out.
        </p>
      </div>

      <H2>What this number is not</H2>
      <div className="mt-4 space-y-4 text-[15px] leading-relaxed sm:text-base">
        <p>
          FTAOE is descriptive. A high number blends playstyle (rim pressure,
          post touches, late-clock creation), contact-seeking skill, and
          officiating, and this method cannot separate those three. In
          particular, it does not isolate and does not prove referee bias, in
          either direction, for any player. That question stays open.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model cannot see who was defending. Per-possession defender
          identity and position exist only in the league's internal tracking
          stack; public matchup data is aggregated and cannot be joined to
          possessions, and a fouled miss has no shot event to attach a
          defender to. That is a real ceiling on how sophisticated a public,
          leak-free baseline can get.
        </p>
        <p>
          On referees: the officiating crew's overall foul tendency is
          adjusted for as context above. We deliberately do not publish
          player-by-referee splits. With three officials per game and a few
          dozen shared games per player-referee pair, those tables are noise
          machines that read as accusations; nothing here supports a claim
          about any referee and any player.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because attempts are attributed to the possession finisher, players
          who draw off-ball fouls are out of scope. Players below{" "}
          <span className="font-mono tnum">{int(meta.qualifyPossessions)}</span>{" "}
          possessions in a season get no percentile and are excluded from the
          leaderboard by default; per-possession rates are unstable in small
          samples. And {int(seasons.length)} seasons is{" "}
          {int(seasons.length)} seasons: a career view this is not.

          Shot-zone charts use charged field-goal attempts only; fouled
          misses have no location, so no chart on this site claims to show
          where fouls happen. Team labels are derived from the possession
          data itself (the teams a player finished possessions for, in order
          of first appearance), which is also how midseason trades show up.
          Home/away and officiating crews come from the NBA's public game
          feeds; drives and touch counts come from the NBA's public tracking
          aggregates. Percentiles are computed within each season's
          qualified pool.
